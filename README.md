# Task

In this task, you'll create a calculator that has two numbers and an operation, and the calculator will perform the operation on those two numbers.

Example, the two numbers could be `3` and `5`, and the operation could be `+`, then the calculator will add `3` and `5`, and print to the user `3 + 5 = 8`.

2. Open this folder in Visual Studio Code.
3. In `calculator.js`, create a variable for the first number.
4. Create a second variable for the second number.
5. Create a third variable for the operation (addition `+`, subtraction `-`, multiplication `*`, or division `/`).
6. Use if-statements to check which operation the variable has.
7. Perform the mathematical operation to the two numbers, and print the result to the user.
